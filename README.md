This is a collection of solutions to coding challenges from a computer science course I took at Ryerson. The PDF file: 109 Python Problems for CCPS 109.pdf contains all the challenges and the .py file:labs109.py have the solutions.

These problems and their test cases have been compiled by Ilkka Kokkarinen from a number of sources ranging from the lab and exam problems of his old Java version of this course to a multitude of programming puzzle and code challenge sites such as LeetCode, CodeAbbey, Stack Exchange Code Golf, and Wolfram Programming Challenges.
